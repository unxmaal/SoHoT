A candidate is either a gateway alias (text modalities) or an engine spec
(anything that runs as a process). Which one it is decides the runner, and a
candidate is only handed the cases it can actually run: giving mflux an SVG
case produces a failure row that says nothing about mflux.

Sequenced by candidate, never interleaved: mlx_lm.server hot-swaps models per
request, so alternating between two aliases pays a model load on every case and
measures disk speed instead of the model.
