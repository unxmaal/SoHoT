"""Snapshot of what produced a result set.

A score sheet without its machine is not comparable to anything, and comparing
this machine against the incoming Studio is a stated goal. This also records
memory pressure, because a run competing with something else is pessimistic and
that fact should live in the results rather than in someone's memory.

THE ACCELERATOR IS RECORDED SEPARATELY. On Apple Silicon `hw_model` identifies
the GPU too, because it is the same part. On a PC it does not: an RTX 4070 run
and an M2 Pro run are otherwise indistinguishable in a results.json, which
defeats the one thing this module exists for.

`swap_used_mb` is macOS-only and reads 0 elsewhere. macOS swap has no honest
one-number equivalent on Windows -- commit charge counts resident RAM too --
and inventing one would make the field incomparable across the machines it
exists to compare.
