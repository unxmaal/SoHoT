"""Runner for the svg lane's OTHER method: draw it, then vectorize it.

The lane has five language models measured on it and all five produce valid
markup that is not the picture -- an LLM writes bezier coordinates it cannot
see. This candidate generates a raster with an image engine and vectorizes it,
and is scored by the SAME svg checker on the SAME cases, which is the only way
the two methods can be compared at all.

The comparison is not like-for-like on cost and should not be read as one: the
LLM path is seconds, this is a diffusion run plus 0.05s of tracing. That is a
real difference and it belongs in the table rather than in a footnote, which is
why the runner reports the engine's wall clock and peak memory honestly.
