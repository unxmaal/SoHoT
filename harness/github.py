"""GitHub's API, cached on disk. Issue #58.

Everything here goes through `gh`, so authentication is whatever the human
already set up: 5000 requests an hour rather than 60.

TWO PROPERTIES THE REST OF THE DISCOVERY LOOP DEPENDS ON.

A response is cached permanently and a FAILED fetch falls back to the stale
copy. A hosted recommender can vanish -- one in the same search was already
archived and marked end-of-service -- and the answer to that is to keep every
fact we ever fetched rather than to pick a more reliable service.

Requests are counted against a budget and the budget is refused, not silently
exceeded. A sweep that quietly burns an hour's rate limit blocks every other
tool on this machine that speaks to GitHub.
