"""What can this machine do that nobody has measured?

Every discovery pass in this project was a person or an agent grepping and
writing prose, which is stale the moment anything is installed and has already
missed things for months:

  * Qwen2.5 entered as a smoke test and served four lanes for four months, and
    nothing reported that the text aliases had never been compared to anything.
  * `local-small`, `q3-1.7b` and `q3-coder` were defined gateway aliases with
    ZERO measurements between them.
  * mflux ships around twenty generate entry points; the image lane has used
    two of them.
  * Kokoro exposes 54 voices; five are cached and three were compared.

A number in a document is wrong by the next commit. A command is right whenever
it is run.

`capabilities()` LOOKS INWARD, at what is installed here. `external()` looks
OUTWARD, because everything this project got wrong about candidate selection was
the world moving while nothing here noticed -- Qwen2.5 served four lanes for
four months while Qwen3 shipped, and ComfyUI was dismissed in one paragraph.

`external()` ASKS REGISTRIES, NOT A LANGUAGE MODEL. A model would produce
plausible names for repositories that do not exist, and this project has a rule
against asserting specifics from pretrained memory. An API answer is a fact with
a URL and a date attached, and it proposes CANDIDATES TO MEASURE rather than
conclusions: the eval decides, this only says what is worth putting in front of
it.

Everything degrades rather than raising: discovery runs on machines that do not
have everything, and a missing tool is a finding rather than a crash.
