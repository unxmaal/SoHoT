"""Does each lane actually work? Run its OWN default and find out.

Asked 2026-09-19: whether any of this works is not known, because most lanes
have never been run here.

The status page says the same: three lanes appear in no receipt on
this machine at all and four more were last measured twelve days ago. A lane
default is a claim until something runs it here.

THIS IS NOT THE SCREEN AND NOT THE MEASURE TIER. Both of those exist to judge
a CHALLENGER. This runs the INCUMBENT alone, to establish that the lane works
at all and to give every later comparison a control that is known to pass.
