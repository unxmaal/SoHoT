"""Does the generated code work?

Every other check in this suite inspects an artifact. This one RUNS it, because
a syntax check is nearly worthless for code: the interesting failures all parse.
An off-by-one, a reversed comparison, a forgotten edge case -- all valid Python.

    THIS EXECUTES MODEL-GENERATED CODE.

The bounds are a subprocess, a wall-clock timeout, and a scratch working
directory, and that is the whole of the sandbox. There is no seccomp, no
container, and no filesystem restriction beyond the cwd: code that calls
shutil.rmtree on an absolute path will do it. That is an acceptable trade for
running your own local models against your own cases on your own machine, and
it is not acceptable for running an eval suite someone else wrote. Read the
cases before you run them.

The result is a FRACTION, not a verdict: three assertions out of four is a
different model from zero out of four, and a binary pass throws that away.

    question, the one the screen tier asks: can this run here AT ALL.

    It exists because it is the failure actually observed. `lh code "a python
    function that parses an ISO timestamp"` returned, on q3-4b:

    datetime.fromisoformat has been in the standard library since 3.7 and is
    imported-but-unused directly above. The eval suite catches this by RUNNING
    the code against a case's assertions; a one-off prompt at the CLI has no
    assertions, so this is the only cheap thing left that would have caught it.
