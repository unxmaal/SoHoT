"""Rasterizing an SVG so the pixel checks apply to it too.

The structural checks read the markup: does it parse, is there an xmlns, how
many shapes were drawn. Every one of those can be true of a document that
renders as an empty rectangle -- white shapes on a white ground, a shape placed
outside the viewBox, a zero-size viewBox, everything hidden behind an opaque
rect. A model that emits well-formed SVG which draws nothing visible passes
every check the suite had. The only way to catch it is to draw it and look.

rsvg-convert is librsvg's CLI. It is an OPTIONAL dependency: when it is absent
the check warns and passes, because a missing tool that failed every candidate
at once would look exactly like a model regression. It is found by name on PATH
or by location -- see RASTERIZER_CANDIDATES for why the second is needed.

HTML goes through headless Chrome, which is already on this machine, so it
needs no Playwright and no npm. Same failure being caught: a page can parse,
have a body, be perfectly self-contained, and render as a white rectangle.
