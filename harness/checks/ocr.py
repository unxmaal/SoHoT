"""Reading text back out of a generated image.

Text rendering is the one image ability the pixel checks are completely blind
to. A sign reading OPEM decodes cleanly, is exactly the size that was asked
for, and has plenty of variance: every check the suite had says it is a good
image.

What comes back is a character error rate rather than a verdict, so two models
that both render something legible can still be ordered. That is the whole
reason the suite needed a quality axis.

ONE LANE, THREE IMPLEMENTATIONS. Apple's Vision on macOS and Windows.Media.Ocr
on Windows both ship with the operating system -- no model download, no server,
a tenth of a second -- which is what makes either usable as a metric rather
than a second thing to install. Linux ships nothing of the kind, so there the
lane is RapidOCR, an ONNX detector plus recogniser that installs as a wheel and
runs on the CPU.

NOT TESSERACT, and this was measured rather than assumed. On the 18 text-render
images this project has actually generated, asking whether the sign's word
appears anywhere in the output at all:

    Vision                  18 / 18
    RapidOCR                18 / 18, exact, no surrounding noise
    tesseract                6 / 18 across four page-segmentation modes
    tesseract + greyscale, autocontrast, 2x    0 / 18

Tesseract is built for scanned documents and this lane is scene text in a
photograph. Shipping it would have reported twelve good renders as total
failures, which is the exact failure the DEFAULT_MAX_CER note below warns
about: measuring the OCR instead of the generator.

WHICH ENGINE RAN IS PART OF THE RESULT. It goes in the eval receipt and
comparable() refuses to rank across two of them, the same way PickScore is not
HPSv2. RapidOCR is the one that runs on all three machines, so pinning it
everywhere is the way to make a CER comparable ACROSS them; the OS engines are
preferred here only because they are free and already installed.

A machine with NEITHER is a third case, and it is not a failure: an image whose
text could not be read is an unmeasured lane, not a bad render. Scoring it as a
loss would blame the generator for a missing dependency.
