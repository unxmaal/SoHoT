"""Is this a usable generated video?

The image checker's argument, one dimension further. "The command exited 0" is
not evidence, and neither is "ffprobe demuxed it": a broken sampler emits a
technically valid MP4 of exactly the right length in which nothing moves, and a
stalled one emits N copies of the first frame. Both play. Both are failures,
and both cost forty minutes to produce.

So the checks are: does it demux, is it the size and length that was asked for,
does each frame contain an image rather than one colour, and does anything
actually change from frame to frame.

`motion` is published as a metric rather than only a threshold, because "more
of a video than the other one" is a real difference between two clips that both
pass the gate.
