"""Did it run at all? The rung between a ranked queue and a measurement.

Issue #148's ladder is sweep, inspect, rank, SCREEN, measure. The screen was
specified in #53 and never connected: `evals.run --screen` exists and stamps a
receipt tier, `screened` has been in the store's verdict vocabulary since the
store was built, and nothing has ever written one. So the queue this project
now ranks is ranked for a tier that cannot see it -- the third time in this
ladder that two correct halves had no rung between them.

WHAT A SCREEN ASKS is binary and cheap: did it run, did it emit an artifact.
That is the right question because it is how things have actually failed here
-- seedvr2 crashed 0/3, local-small never closed a tag 0/9, q3-14b returned
null content behind a passing rate. Almost nothing has failed by running and
scoring slightly worse.

IT NEVER DOWNLOADS. Fetching is its own explicit step (`lh fetch --run`) with
its own disk budget, and a tier that quietly pulls gigabytes because something
ranked well is how a laptop fills up overnight. A candidate whose weights are
absent is reported as waiting on a fetch, not screened and not failed.

#: lane -> how to spell a candidate of that lane for evals.run, given a model
#: id. Empty means this harness has no way to invoke an arbitrary model in that
#: lane, which is a fact about the harness rather than about the candidate.
#:
#: The specs are the ones evals.run already parses; nothing new is invented
#: here, because a second spelling of the candidate language is the defect that
#: this project has filed twice under other names.
#: mlx_lm.server treats the request's `model` as a live repo id and swaps to
#: it, so a text candidate needs no prefix and no config entry. That is true of
#: every lane in lanes.TEXT_SERVED and only `code` was listed, so `web` and
#: `svg` -- the 3rd and 4th priorities -- reported `no-runner` for a candidate
#: the harness could in fact have screened. Issue #207.
#:
#: A LANE HOLDS MORE THAN ONE ENGINE, in preference order. It held exactly one
#: until 2026-09-21, and that single entry was doing the job of an adoption:
#: `mflux` was the image lane because it had been typed here, and since
#: mflux.ENTRY_POINTS is an enumerated table of families that no discovered
#: repo id is ever in, every challenger the loop found was refused before it
#: could be measured. The incumbent had never won anything. RULE #271's third
#: occurrence and the only one whose fix is not another per-lane patch.
#:
#: The order is INCUMBENT FIRST, which is a claim that measurement can settle
#: and currently has not: when both engines can run a model, the first one
#: listed gets it.
