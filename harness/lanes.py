"""One definition of what a lane is, because there were four.

Four modules each decided the set of lanes independently and no two agreed:

    discover.LANES          image stt svg text tts video
    screen.LANE_CANDIDATES  image stt code tts
    rank.LANE_PRIORITY      image code web svg video
    evals/cases/*           image stt svg code tts video web extract

`image` was the only lane in all four, so one lane of five could travel the
whole ladder. `code` could be measured and screened and not searched for;
`web` could be measured and nothing else; `svg` could be searched for and not
screened. Issue #207.

These are four genuinely different questions -- what can be searched for, what
can be screened, what is wanted, what can be measured -- so the fix is not one
table. It is one NAMING, here, plus a test that every table covers it.

#: Every lane, in the priority order this harness was given, then the ones
#: nobody asked for. A directory under evals/cases must exist for each, and
#: tests/test_harness_lanes.py asserts it.
#:
#: `music` is APPENDED rather than inserted. The five before it were ranked
#: explicitly; music was asked for later and has never been ranked against
#: them, so it is wanted and it is wanted last until somebody says otherwise.
#: Issue #237.
#: `decide` is appended the same way: asked for 2026-10-06 to measure
#: Bespoke-Nimble-9B against its baselines, never ranked against the rest. #423.
#: `agent` is appended the same way: a model as opencode and Claude Code use it,
#: tool calls over a repo, asked for 2026-10-06. #474.
#: `ocr` is appended the same way: approved 2026-10-07 once three models recurred. #562.
WANTED = ("image", "code", "web", "svg", "video", "music", "decide", "agent", "ocr")

#: Measured here, and not on the wanted list. `extract` has more cases than any
#: lane but stt and is a text job; stt and tts have the most measurement
#: history in the project and the person this harness is for does not want them
#: ranked ahead of the five above.

#: Old name -> the name that survives. `text` and `code` were the same lane:
#: discover.py wrote `text` (10 proposals) and inspect.PIPELINE_LANES mapped
#: `text-generation` to `code` (38 proposals). rank.lane_of then discarded
#: `text` as laneless, so half the lane was silently dropped from the queue.
#:
#: `all` is a SOURCE's coverage claim, never a candidate's lane, and recording
#: it as one put 243 of 323 proposals in a lane that does not exist.
ALIASES = {"text": "code", "all": ""}

#: lane -> (why it is not run here, what would change that). A PARKED lane is
#: a DECISION, not a gap, and the difference is the whole point of this table:
#: `unverified` says nobody has got round to it and invites somebody to,
#: whereas parked says somebody looked and chose, and names the condition
#: under which the choice expires.
#:
#: Empty since the Studio ran video in 7.3 minutes (#347). It stays in
#: verify.DELIBERATE, so it runs only when asked for by name.

#: `model` as a live repo id and swaps to it. One prompt, one completion, a
#: structural check on the output. The four differ in what they ask for and not
#: in what runs them, which is why they can share both a registry query and a
#: candidate spec.
#: `agent` is served by the same text model through the same route; its runner
#: is a tool loop rather than one completion, chosen by modality in evals.run. #474.

#: Lanes whose winner no program can pick, so a person does. Not a failure to
#: find the right metric: per the 2026 literature there is no per-clip
#: style-similarity metric at all, FAD is distributional and cannot score one
#: clip, and human preference studies are the field's ground truth. This
#: project reached the same wall three times before naming it -- cover
#: similarity (#272), musical quality (KNOWLEDGE #154), and svg aesthetics
#: (KNOWLEDGE #108, "no check can see that OmniSVG's gear is a better-looking
#: gear"). Issue #273.
#:
#: A lane here still runs every programmatic check it has. `music` keeps its
#: sung-lyric WER and its duration adherence; what it gains is a verdict for
#: the part those cannot see.
