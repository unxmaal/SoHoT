"""Speaking and hearing through the local mlx-audio server.

Kokoro for TTS and Parakeet for STT, both on 8890, both OpenAI-compatible.
Measured through this stack: stt 0.1s, tts generation 0.4s, 12-13x realtime.

Two failure modes are handled explicitly because both look like success:

  * mlx_audio answers HTTP 200 with an EMPTY BODY when misaki (Kokoro's
    grapheme-to-phoneme frontend) is missing, logging the ImportError
    server-side. A caller that trusts the status code writes a 0-byte file.
  * A bare 44-byte WAV header passes `test -s` and plays as silence.
