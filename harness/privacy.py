"""Find one person's home setup in text meant for strangers. Issue #136.

This repo is public. Every issue, PR body and doc is published, and prose
describing the author's desk -- a named volume, a spare drive in a particular
tower, which box plays games -- teaches a reader nothing and dates fast.

A MEASUREMENT KEEPS ITS HARDWARE. "Measured on an RTX 4070" is provenance and
must survive; the card is part of the instrument. What this refuses is the
domestic arrangement around it.
