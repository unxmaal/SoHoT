"""Where the gateway config is, asked once.

Five modules resolved this independently -- coverage, discover, rank, and
screen twice -- with the same expression copied five times:

    Path(os.environ.get("GATEWAY_CONFIG", <repo> / "gateway" / "config.yaml"))

That is the "one question, two answers" class, and the fifth copy was added
while fixing a different instance of it. The copies agree today; nothing made
them, and a sixth would agree only by the author remembering.
