"""Can the weights this repo names actually be obtained?

CLASS 11 OF THE GAUNTLET: external state with no assertion on it. Every alias
in a gateway config points at somebody else's published artifact. Each was
obtainable when it was written, nothing here notices when one stops being, and
the failure arrives on a machine rather than in CI.

#147 is the proof and it was found by hand, on a bare Linux box, by trying:
config.cuda.yaml names four GGUFs that cannot be fetched as written. One is
split into shards, one is published only at Q8_0, one lives behind a repo that
401s, and two differ from their upstream filenames ONLY IN CASE. The router
echoes the stem verbatim, so the two aliases that worked were exactly the two
whose upstream names happened to match.

TWO CHECKS, because the two configs name two different kinds of thing:

  resolvable  OFFLINE and structural. A repo id says where it comes from. A
              bare GGUF stem does not, so nothing -- no person and no script --
              can tell whether it is obtainable without guessing the repo. That
              missing provenance IS #147's defect rather than a symptom of it.

  reachable   NETWORK. The repo id answers. Marked slow, never in `make check`:
              a lint that fails when HuggingFace has a bad afternoon teaches
              people to skip lint.
