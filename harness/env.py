"""Where the weights live, resolved by the CLI rather than by the shell.

`scripts/env.sh` has always done this for the services, but it is SOURCED: it
only helps a shell that ran it. Once `lh` is installed on PATH it runs from any
directory with nothing sourced, and `lh image` spawns mflux, which reads
HF_HOME. Unset, huggingface_hub silently falls back to ~/.cache/huggingface and
starts re-downloading weights that are already on the volume -- gigabytes, with
no error, onto the disk this machine has least of.

THERE IS NO CANDIDATE LIST ANY MORE. This used to hunt through
two named external volumes and ~/.cache/huggingface, which is one person's
Mac written into the repo: the Windows port had to fork the list
in Python, env.sh had to fork it again in shell, and a test existed whose only
job was to notice when the two forks drifted. The default is now a path inside
the working tree, and a machine that wants a fast drive says so with HF_ROOT.

WHAT IS SAID IS STILL CHECKED. An explicit HF_ROOT goes through the same
writability and free-space tests as the default; it does NOT bypass them. That
was a real bug once -- an unwritable and a nonexistent path both passed with
exit 0 -- and "the caller says where" must not become "and stop looking".
The rule is FREE SPACE, not "is this external": that refuses this machine's
internal disk, which sits at 91%, for the reason that actually matters, and it
will not refuse the Studio's.
