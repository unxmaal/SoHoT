"""The constants issue #98 asks about, wired to run against cached data.

Every probe here is offline and deterministic. The GitHub client is built with
a zero request budget and an effectively infinite TTL, so nothing is fetched
and a missing cache entry is an error rather than a silent network call; the
source probes read clones already on disk and size models from the size cache
only. That is what makes the sweep re-runnable in a second rather than a
morning, which is the difference between a check that gets run and one that
does not.

A cache miss skips a candidate, so the candidate set may be smaller than a live
sweep's. It is the SAME set at every value of a constant, so the comparison
stays fair; `coverage()` reports the size so a reader can see what it was.
