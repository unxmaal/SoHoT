"""Order a queue of candidates by what is worth LEARNING, not by who will win.

Issue #175. The judge tier scored twenty-five real candidates 3/10 each, behind
a control that separated at +7. Two further controls, shaped like the data the
tier actually meets, settled why:

    bare     a name and nothing else            0 of 3 runs separated
    carded   the registry's own description     0 of 3 runs separated

Six models with known opposite outcomes -- the STT engine this project measured
and adopted against the one it measured and dropped -- all scored 3. The reason
string says it plainly: "a new model with no concrete measured claim". The
rubric's top criterion is a measured claim, and A REGISTRY CARD NEVER CONTAINS
ONE. No wording fixes that, and no amount of extra metadata does either.

THE DEEPER ERROR WAS IN THE QUESTION. `parakeet` beat `whisper-large-v3` on WER
and latency, and nothing in either card could have told you that -- the fact was
produced by running them. A triage tier cannot order candidates by eventual
quality, because eventual quality is what the tiers below it exist to find out.

What triage CAN order is the value of the information a screen would buy:

    a lane nobody has measured yet     a screen there answers an open question
    a thing seen again and again       recurrence over time, this project's own
                                       answer to a feed measuring popularity
    something unlike what is served    a requantised copy of a model already
                                       running here teaches nothing
    cheap to screen                    small weights, a shorter round trip

Every one of those is a fact the store already holds, so this is arithmetic
rather than an opinion: deterministic, seeded by nothing, and testable without a
gateway. That matters as much as the ordering -- the instrument it replaces was
a sampling language model whose control had to be run three times to be believed.
