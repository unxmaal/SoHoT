"""One large working set at a time, across processes. Issue #137.

harness/jobs.py already enforces this, but only inside ONE process, so it
guards the MCP caller and leaves `lh` free to collide with itself. Every `lh`
invocation is a new process, so serialising them needs the operating system.

MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. 2026-09-12 on the M2 Pro: `lh image` started while
`lh video` held the GPU. Both went straight at it, Metal returned
kIOGPUCommandBufferCallbackErrorTimeout, swap reached 8.0 GB of 9.2, and both
jobs were killed with no artifact. That is ERROR #33 and assumption C4.

An advisory file lock, NOT a pidfile. A lock the kernel holds is released when
the process dies however it dies -- killed, crashed, OOM -- so there is no
stale-lock path to get wrong. The 2026-09-12 incident ended in exactly the kill
a pidfile scheme handles worst.
