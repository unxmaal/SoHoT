"""localharness over MCP: the same `lh`, reachable from the LAN.

A second agent on another machine (its own Claude Code, its own context) asks
this one to draw something. What crosses the network is a tool call; what runs
here is the same command line a local agent would type.

THAT IS THE DESIGN CONSTRAINT. Every tool shells out to `lh`. The repo's
standing rule is that the CLI and the eval suite run identical commands,
because for a while only the eval knew how to invoke a generator and the
harness could measure something the product did not ship. A third caller obeys
the same rule, and shelling out is how it stays true by construction rather
than by discipline.

SCOPED DELIBERATELY to svg, web, code and image. Video is 40 minutes and a
large file, which needs job semantics past a queue, and speaking over the LAN
was ruled out. Both are reachable locally with `lh`.

THE EXPENSIVE LANE IS QUEUED. `lh image` holds 11.4 GiB for 20-54 seconds and
mlx_lm.server swaps models per request through a single queue. Two callers
without a queue means each inserts a full model load into the other's request
on a machine that swaps if both hold weights at once. So `image` returns a job
id, and the queue reports what a caller is waiting behind.

    ./scripts/serve-mcp.sh          # 0.0.0.0, no auth, trusted LAN only

The other machine adds one entry pointing at http://<host>.local:8899/mcp
