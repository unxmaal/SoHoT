# Stopping first would mean one apt round-trip per missing package.
#
# NO pipefail HERE, deliberately. Nearly every check is `producer | grep -q`,
# and grep -q exits at the first match, so the producer takes a SIGPIPE and
# pipefail reports the whole pipeline as failed. That turns present things into
# absent ones: it marked DejaVu missing on a machine that had both the fonts
# and fc-list.
