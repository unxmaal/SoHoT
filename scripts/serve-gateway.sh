# Binds every interface by default. Deliberate: this is a trusted LAN, the models
# are local, and the point of the machine is that other machines on it can use
# the GPU. It is also the shape the M5 Studio needs, with the Studio serving and
# the Apple Silicon machine as a client. There is NO AUTHENTICATION -- set GATEWAY_HOST=127.0.0.1 on an
# untrusted network.
#
# --host is passed explicitly regardless. LiteLLM's own default is 0.0.0.0, so
# omitting the flag would make the binding invisible: every doc in this repo
# once said "127.0.0.1:4000" while lsof said "*:4000". State it, whichever it is.
# UTF-8 REGARDLESS OF THE MACHINE'S CODEPAGE. Python picks its stdio encoding
# from the locale, which is cp1252 on a stock Windows install, and anything
# printing a character outside it dies. LiteLLM's startup banner does exactly
# that, so the gateway exited during startup with a UnicodeEncodeError while
# every one of its own settings was correct. Only visible when output is
# redirected to a file, which is how a service runs.
