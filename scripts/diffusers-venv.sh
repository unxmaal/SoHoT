# ONE venv for both lanes. They want the same torch and the same diffusers, and
# CUDA torch is 2.5 GB: building it twice would cost five gigabytes to run two
# scripts that import the same module. It is separate from the project's venv
# for the reason mflux is a `uv tool` on the Mac -- the test suite has no need
# of a CUDA torch, and `uv sync` should not drag one in.
#
# The two indexes cannot be collapsed. torch+cu124 is published only on
# PyTorch's own index and diffusers only on PyPI, so pointing a single
# --index-url at both resolves the CPU build, and the lane then runs in minutes
# where the card takes seconds.
