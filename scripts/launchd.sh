FATAL: a launchd agent cannot read $root ($verdict).

  macOS TCC protects /Volumes, and a background job has no way to ask for
  consent. The volume stats fine and shows up in /Volumes, so nothing looks
  wrong until mlx_lm hangs forever inside os.listdir -- serving no requests
  and logging no error.

  To fix, grant Full Disk Access to the program launchd runs:
    System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access > +
    add /bin/bash   (this is broad; a narrower option is to point these
                     units at a dedicated interpreter and grant only that)

  Then re-run: ./scripts/launchd.sh install

  Or skip launchd and start the services from a terminal that already has
  the access, which is what ./scripts/serve-*.sh do today.
