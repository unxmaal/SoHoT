# Kokoro TTS and Parakeet STT on the GPU via mlx-audio, speaking an
# OpenAI-compatible /v1/audio/speech and /v1/audio/transcriptions.
#
# Port 8890 is deliberate: voicemode's provider_discovery.py classifies that
# port as "mlx-audio" and then stops sending it "whisper-1", which is the whole
# reason the old stt_shim existed. Native detection replaces 120 lines of proxy.
# Binds every interface by default. Deliberate: this is a trusted LAN, the models
# are local, and the point of the machine is that other machines on it can use
# the GPU. It is also the shape the M5 Studio needs, with the Studio serving and
# the Apple Silicon machine as a client. There is NO AUTHENTICATION -- set TTS_HOST=127.0.0.1 on an
# untrusted network.

# misaki is Kokoro's grapheme-to-phoneme frontend. Without it the endpoint
# returns HTTP 200 with an EMPTY BODY and logs the ImportError server-side, so
# callers must check that the audio file is non-empty rather than trusting the
# status code. voice/speak.sh does.
#
# The setuptools pin is RULE #143: webrtcvad still imports pkg_resources, uv does
# not install setuptools into venvs on py3.12+, and setuptools >=81 removed
# pkg_resources outright. Unpinned resolves to 84.x and fails the same way.
# soundfile: granite-speech-nar and arktts read an audio path through it; mlx-audio does not require it. #1030
