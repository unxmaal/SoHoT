# Model weights must not land on the internal disk. It runs at 91% and a single
# 70B at 4-bit is ~40GB, while the MiniMax-H3 checkpoint alone is 134GB. Left to
# itself, huggingface_hub silently recreates its cache under $HOME and fills it.
#
# Candidate order is by MEASURED throughput (4 GiB dd, cold read forced by
# unmount/remount so the page cache cannot flatter the number):
#
#   a 10Gbps enclosure, ioreg Speed=4 (SuperSpeed+), direct to a host
#     controller. 1013 MB/s write, 959 MB/s cold read.
#   a portable SSD, ioreg Speed=3 (5 Gbps) because it sits behind a USB3.0
#     hub. 422/432 MB/s, 2.2x slower. The drive is itself a 10 Gbps device;
#     the hub halves it.
#
# Load time scales directly with this, and mlx_lm.server hot-swaps models per
# request, so the cost is paid on every switch: ~40GB is ~42s at 959 MB/s.
#
# The rule is FREE SPACE, not "is this the internal disk". The old rule refused
# "/" and /System/Volumes/* categorically, which encoded this particular
# machine: an M2 mini at 91% full. The M5 Ultra Studio has a large internal SSD
# and may have no external volume attached at all, and a categorical rule would
# refuse it on day one. Nothing about being internal is disqualifying; running
# out of room is, so the threshold says that directly. On THIS machine the
# threshold still refuses the internal disk, for the reason that actually
# matters.
#
# 160GB because MiniMax-H3's FL2VA checkpoint alone is 134GiB and
# fetch-h3-weights.sh demands that much headroom. A smaller threshold would let
# this guard pass and the download fail instead.
#
# Overrides, all validated the same way rather than trusted:
#   HF_ROOT         where the weights live (default: ./hf_root in the checkout)
#   HF_MIN_FREE_GB  how much room a location must have

# Enough for a normal model, not enough for MiniMax-H3. This was 160 for that
# one checkpoint, which made every ordinary machine unusable to guard a
# download that guards itself: fetch-h3-weights.sh demands its own 160GB and
# setup-omnisvg.sh its own 40, where the size is actually known.
