# llama.cpp's router: the text lane's engine on a machine with an NVIDIA card.
#
# The counterpart of serve-mlx.sh, and the same shape rather than a different
# one. Both hold the models in ONE process and pick between them by the `model`
# field a request carries, so gateway/config.cuda.yaml names an alias per model
# against a single api_base, exactly as the Mac config does. One port per model
# was the obvious alternative and it is wrong here: a sweep would need every
# candidate resident at once, and 12 GB does not hold two 8B models.
#
# --models-max is 1 rather than the router's default of 4. Four resident models
# is an out-of-memory on a 12 GB card, and harness/memory.py already budgets on
# the assumption that one model is resident and a swap may briefly hold two.
# A larger card can raise it.

# Loopback only: it takes no key, so another machine uses this GPU through the
# gateway on this one, which does (#482). LLAMACPP_HOST overrides.
#
# Port 8081 is mlx_lm.server's, on purpose. Only one of the two runs on any one
# machine, and sharing the port means gateway/config.cuda.yaml differs from the
# Mac config only in which weights it names.
# GIVE THE CARD BACK WHEN IDLE. This machine is a machine with a day job that also
# runs this, and a server left up otherwise holds the model for as long
# as the process lives. Measured on the 4070: a request takes VRAM from
# 2462 to 3296 MiB, and fifteen seconds after the last one it reads 2473
# again. The router reloads on the next request, at the cost of the load
# time and nothing else. Set LLAMACPP_SLEEP_IDLE=-1 to serve full time.
# Context is explicit: unset, a 4B model sized its cache to ~21 GB. #286.
# --jinja: the model's own chat template, which OpenAI tool calls need. #297.
