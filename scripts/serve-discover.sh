# The sweep, on a schedule. Issue #261.
#
# THIS IS THE PRODUCT'S PREMISE. Obsoletion-proofing that has to be typed by a
# person is a script, not a property of the system: the loop turns only when
# somebody remembers, and what it is meant to protect against is precisely the
# passage of unattended time.
#
# NOT A SERVER, despite living beside the serve-* scripts. launchd runs it on
# an interval and it exits; the plist carries StartInterval rather than
# KeepAlive, or launchd would restart a finished sweep immediately and the
# machine would discover in a tight loop.

# already refuses to exceed these and they are here so the answer is visible in
