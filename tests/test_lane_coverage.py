"""Every lane driven through the fake ladder, and an inventory of the gaps.

Issue #264. Every defect #262 fixed was found in `image` or `code`, which are
the two lanes that have recorded fixtures. That is not a coincidence: a lane
nothing drives is not a lane known to work, it is a lane nobody has looked at.

This file asks ONE question of every lane -- can a candidate be spelled and
planned for it -- and reports the lanes that cannot by name. It starts as an
INVENTORY rather than a gate, because several lanes genuinely cannot, and each
converts to a gate the moment it lands.
