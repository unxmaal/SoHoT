"""The lane scope must not be a sample of the backlog. Issue #209.

`--lane` was applied AFTER `ms.judgeable(limit=top * 4)`, so a narrow budget
narrowed the population the filter could see. At --top 25 the sample is 100 of
114 and nothing shows; at --top 2 it is 8, and the image lane reported empty
while holding five candidates. A narrow budget is when the scope matters most.
