"""One question must not have two answers.

THE VIOLATION: a policy decided once and written down twice, with nothing
holding the copies together. Both are right the day they are written and they
drift the first time only one is edited.

It has happened six times here, which is why this file exists as a CENSUS
rather than a seventh bespoke test. Nobody could see the pattern until it had
already happened five times, each fix filed as its own unrelated bug.

The registry below is the artifact. A seventh instance costs a row.
