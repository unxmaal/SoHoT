"""The MCP surface: the same `lh` a local agent runs, reachable from the LAN.

A second operator gets svg, web, code and image from their own Claude Code on
their own machine. Everything here shells out to `lh` rather than reimplementing it,
because the repo's rule is that every caller runs identical commands -- the CLI
and the eval suite already do, and a third caller that drifted would expose a
product nobody ships.

These tests never generate anything. They assert the command built, the shape
of what comes back, and that the expensive lane goes through the queue.
