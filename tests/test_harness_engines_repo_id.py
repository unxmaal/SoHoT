"""A discovered candidate is always a repo id, and the image lane refused one.

`engines.mflux_binary` picked the entry point by `model.startswith(prefix)`
against a fixed family list, so the owner prefix of
`filipstrand/Z-Image-Turbo-mflux-4bit` hid `z-image-turbo`. engine_for
swallowed the ValueError, modality_of returned None, and cases_for fell
through to the text modalities, of which image is not one. The image lane
could screen its own typed defaults and nothing the loop found. Issue #213.
