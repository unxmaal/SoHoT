"""A claimed failure mode must be the observed one.

THE VIOLATION: a claim that several processes writing one SQLite file is how
you corrupt it. It was wrong, and it was corrected on the spot. SQLite
SERIALISES writers; the failure is `database is locked`, and the difference
matters because the two have opposite fixes. Corruption says "use another
database". A lock timeout says "set one".

So this file does not reason about it. It runs two writers.

#148 is about to put several pods against this store, which is why the answer
had to stop being an opinion.
