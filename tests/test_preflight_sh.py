"""Behaviour of scripts/preflight.sh, the host-level check for a new machine.

The script's whole value is telling the truth about what a machine has, so the
failure that matters is a WRONG answer, not a crash. It shipped one on its
first run: `fc-list | grep -qi dejavu` under `set -o pipefail` reported the
fonts missing on a machine that had both the fonts and fc-list, because grep -q
exits at the first match and the producer then dies of SIGPIPE. shellcheck
cannot see that, and a green shellcheck is what made it look finished.

NOTHING HERE DEPENDS ON WHAT THE RUNNER HAS INSTALLED. Every test builds a
PATH containing only stubs it created, so "ffmpeg is missing" means the test
said so and not that the runner lacks ffmpeg. That is the same reasoning as
test_env_sh.py: a test whose result depends on the machine is a test CI cannot
defend.

# A preflight that FAILS on a player lh can use is noise. A preflight that
# PASSES on a player lh cannot use is worse: it certifies a lane that does not
# work. Same reasoning as test_the_python_and_shell_defaults_agree in
