"""Where the weights live, resolved by the CLI itself.

`scripts/env.sh` has always done this for the SERVICES, but it is sourced by a
shell. Once `lh` is on PATH it runs from any directory, in any shell, with
nothing sourced -- and `lh image` spawns mflux, which reads HF_HOME. Unset, it
falls back to ~/.cache/huggingface and starts re-downloading weights that are
already on the volume.

ONE LOCATION, CHECKED. There is no candidate list any more: a search is how the
wrong disk gets chosen quietly, and the list was one person's Mac written into
the repo, forked once for Windows here and again in shell.
