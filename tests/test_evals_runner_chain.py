"""Two-stage image workflows: generate, then do something to the result.

This is the vocabulary ComfyUI is wanted for, and mflux ships all of it
natively in MLX -- controlnet, depth, fill, redux, kontext, in-context, two
upscalers. Nineteen primitives, and until now none of them could be a candidate
because every runner here assumed one command produces the artifact.

`upscale:` is the first, and the shape is deliberately general: a base engine
produces an image, a second command consumes it. Adding `controlnet:` later
should be a stage definition, not another runner.
