"""A verdict is a fact about the machine that made it. Issue #266.

The store is shared across three machines and recorded only WHAT was decided.
A refusal is routinely a fact about one of them -- `needs-cuda` is true on an
mlx-only machine and false on one with the card, `too-big` is measured against a ceiling that
describes one 32 GB machine -- so a verdict made elsewhere read as a fact
about the model, and could not be found again when the machine changed.

56 rows in the real store carried the machine as prose inside `detail`, and
the only identifier in it was `arm64`.
