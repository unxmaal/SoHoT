"""Behaviour of scripts/env.sh, the guard on where model weights land.

This script exists to stop huggingface_hub silently recreating its cache
somewhere with no room, re-downloading tens of GB with no error.

NOTHING HERE NEEDS A MOUNTED VOLUME. It used to: every test was skipped unless
/Volumes/FAST was attached, so all 29 skipped on both CI runners and ran only
on one Mac. Ten of them then failed there for a week while CI stayed green,
because a skip and a pass look the same at a glance. A test CI cannot execute
is a test CI cannot defend, so these use tmp_path and the free-space threshold
is passed in rather than depending on what any particular disk has today.
