"""The seam between the code and the image that runs it.

GAUNTLET, "each half verified against its own spec, the seam against nothing".
The code was tested. The image built. Neither knew about the other, so
`harness/github.py` shelled out to `gh` while the Dockerfile installed only
`git`, and the first real fan-out failed all 125 candidates with

    [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'gh'

Nobody owned the agreement, so nobody tested it. This does: the binaries the
source invokes BY BARE NAME are extracted mechanically and checked against what
the Dockerfile installs.

TIER 1 on purpose. One side is machine-readable, which is more often true of a
seam than it looks, and a scan covers tools nobody has added yet.
