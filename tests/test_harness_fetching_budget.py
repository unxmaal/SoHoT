"""--budget-gib is the ceiling on one invocation, and it was never enforced.

`lh discover --loop --run --budget-gib 12` printed the budget in the fetch
header and downloaded 24.6 GiB, because _loop_spend never passed it to
fetching.run. Issue #215.

A REAL STORE, NOT A FAKE CONNECTION. These first used a stub whose execute()
answered one query shape, which broke the moment queued() asked the store a
second question (#224). A fake that models one call tests that call.
