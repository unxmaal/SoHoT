"""What discovery asks a registry for depends on what the machine can run.

Every query was prefixed `mlx-community/`, which is right on a Mac and asks a
Mac question everywhere else: a sweep from a box with an NVIDIA card searched
HuggingFace for weights that cannot load on it, found them, and proposed them.

Keyed by RUNTIME rather than by platform, so a Linux box with the same card
asks the same questions and a new kind of machine is a row.
