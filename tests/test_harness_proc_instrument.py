"""What `phys_footprint` sees that `maximum resident set size` does not.

Issue #238 was filed on the premise that phys_footprint OVER-reports: the music
lane recorded a 36.3 GiB peak on a 32 GB machine, against 13.82 GiB taken with
`ru_maxrss` inside the same process. The obvious reading is that the larger
number is wrong.

It is the other way round, and these are the controls that settle it. Both
numbers come from ONE `/usr/bin/time -l` run, so they describe the same
process:

    plain 2 GiB bytearray     rss 2.01 GiB   footprint 2.01 GiB   ratio  1.00
    plain 4 GiB bytearray     rss 4.02 GiB   footprint 4.01 GiB   ratio  1.00
    numpy 2 GiB               rss 2.02 GiB   footprint 2.02 GiB   ratio  1.00
    mlx 2 GiB array           rss 0.03 GiB   footprint 2.02 GiB   ratio 62.80
    torch mps 2 GiB           rss 0.21 GiB   footprint 2.16 GiB   ratio 10.05

Where the truth is known, the two instruments AGREE. On a Metal allocation of
exactly the same size, resident set size sees almost nothing while the
footprint is right. RSS cannot see unified-memory buffers, so on this platform
it is the blind instrument, and every MLX lane in this repo would report a
fraction of its real cost if proc.py were "fixed" to use it.

ACE-Step measured the same way: rss 11.26 GiB, footprint 36.27 GiB.

THESE TESTS EXIST TO STOP A PLAUSIBLE FIX. Swapping phys_footprint for maxrss
looks like a correction and would silently under-report every Metal workload
the project runs.
