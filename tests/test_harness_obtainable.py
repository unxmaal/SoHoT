"""Gauntlet, "external state with no assertion on it".

Every gateway alias points at somebody else's published artifact. Each was
obtainable when written, and nothing here notices when one stops being. #147 is
the proof: four GGUFs in config.cuda.yaml cannot be fetched as written, found
by hand on a bare Linux box, by trying.

Red-proofed the way harness/privacy.py is: the negative cases matter more,
because a check that flags every alias gets switched off within a week.
