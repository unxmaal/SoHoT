"""A reference must resolve.

THE VIOLATION: a name that pointed at something real when it was written. It
is the same decay as a number without its configuration -- true once, read as
true forever, and nothing notices the move.

Scoped to repo-relative paths, because those are the references this repo can
actually check. A URL needs the network and a model id needs a registry; both
belong in a slower job than `make check`.
