"""Ranking a proposal by how much it looks like it runs HERE.

relevance() scored +2 for Apple terms and -1 for cuda, nvidia, rtx, vram, 4090.
On a Mac that is right. On the box with the card it scores a CUDA technique
NEGATIVE, sorts it last and the limit then cuts it, so the proposals most worth
that machine's time are the ones it never sees.

Techniques matter more here than models. A model can be found in a registry; a
LoRA that makes an existing job five times faster is only ever mentioned in
prose, and prose about a technique names the hardware it was measured on. That
is exactly the text this function reads.
