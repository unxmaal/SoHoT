"""Turning a raster into vector paths.

The svg lane's five language models all draw the same thing: valid markup that
is not the picture. Asked for a frog holding a coffee mug they produced
coloured blobs; asked for two concentric gears, two offset squares. A diffusion
model draws the frog in 54s and vtracer turns it into real paths in 0.05s.

This module is that second step. It is deliberately thin: the value is the
PIPELINE, and vtracer is someone else's Rust that already works.
