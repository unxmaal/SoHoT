"""The services must start the same way twice.

`uv run --with litellm[proxy]` resolves the latest release on every launch. A
restart therefore silently changes 107 packages, which is the opposite of what
you want from a machine whose whole purpose is producing comparable
measurements: a number from last week and a number from today would have been
produced by different software.

It is also slow. The gateway restart in this session downloaded 22.5 MiB and
reinstalled 107 packages before it could serve.

These are grep-level assertions on the scripts rather than behavioural tests,
for the same reason `make lint` is: the alternative is starting real services
in CI, and the failure being guarded against is a missing pin, which is visible
in the text.
