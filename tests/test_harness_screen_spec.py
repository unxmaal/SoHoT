"""A spec must survive being spelled twice. Issue #214.

The challenger arrives from the store as a bare repo id; the incumbent arrives
from winners.typed() already spelled `mflux:flux2-klein-4b`. candidate_for
wrapped both, so the lane's own control became `mflux:mflux:flux2-klein-4b`,
which resolve() rejects. The control contributed no cases, the challenger ran
alone, and the loop printed the pairing it intended above a one-sided receipt.
