"""Starting and stopping the desktop's servers.

This script was verified by hand, once, with a stub launcher, and the Windows
branch by use. Issue #131. A check that exists only as something a person did
is not a check, which is the standard this project holds everything else to.

No seam was needed. services.sh resolves its launchers relative to its own
location, so each test copies it into a temporary tree beside fake serve-*.sh
scripts and drives the real verbs against them.
